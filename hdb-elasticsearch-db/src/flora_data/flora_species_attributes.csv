Habitat: Occurs in the understorey of tropical rain forests in Southeast Asia.																		Foliage: Leaves large and ovate with entire leaf margin (20 cm long). They are green with a white stripe along the midvein and many white, irregularly-shaped spots. Petioles form a whitish sheath around the stem. Flowers: Small inflorescences are thin, unisexual with a white or greenish spathe (hood-like structure that surrounds the rod-like inflorescence). In cultivation, plants rarely produce inflorescences. Fruits: Fruits are small berries.																		Landscaping: In warm, humid climates, this species may be grown in north-facing slopes or shady areas, such as under trees. They are often displayed in containers, both indoors and outdoors.																		Cultivation: This species is easy-to-grow. Plant in well-drained, fertile soil, such as sandy soil enriched with humus. Heavily mulch plants to keep the soil moist. Leaves may turn brown when plants are watered with hard or cold water. Indoor plants may be potted in a mixture of potting soil and styrofoam. Feed weekly with a half-strength fertilizer solution. Allow potted plants to become slightly rootbound for best growth. It grows best in humid air. To increase humidity, spray leaves regularly with warm, soft water free of lime and / or place the pot on a bed of wet pebbles. Plants grown in dry air will become susceptible to aphids, mealybugs, scale insects and spider mites. Propagation: Propagate by tip cuttings or dividing the clumps. 																		Etymology: The genus ""Aglaonema"" is derived from the Greek words ""aglos"" meaning bright and ""nema"" meaning thread. The specific epithet ""costatum"" comes from the Latin word ""costatus"" meaning ribbed. The reference is to the white stripe that occurs along the leaf midrib."

Stem: Short, herbaceous stem (5 cm wide).  Foliage: Narrow, erect leaves are lance-shaped (40 - 50 cm long, 8 - 10 cm wide). Leaf margin is pinnately lobed, having a scalloped edge. Leaves are spirally arranged and directly attached to the top of the short stem. Petioles are curled inward like a cone and striped or mottled dark purple and olive green. The midvein and lateral veins branching off the midvein are raised. The upper surface of leaves is dark green, while the lower surface is purple to reddish purple. Young leaves are glossy, but become waxy at maturity. Flowers: Whitish to greenish flowers resemble calla flowers. The flower consists of a stick-like spadix and petal-like spathe that surrounds the spadix like a hood. Fruits: Fruits are reddish berries.																		Landscaping: This species is easy to maintain and grows well indoors. It is grown for its ornamental foliage which have a tropical look. The unique shape of the spirally arranged, erect leaves make this species an ideal focal plant. This species is relatively new to the horticultural trade.																		Cultivation: Plant this species in fertile, well-drained soil that is kept moist. It grows well in slightly acidic to acidic soils (pH 5.5 - 6.5). Individuals should be planted 0.3 - 0.5 m apart. Plants should be protected from the wind. Try to avoid moving the plant or transplanting it, because it may cause the outer leaves to turn yellow. This species forms dense clumps that need to be thinned regularly. It is susceptible to mealy bugs and scale insects, as well as bacterial and fungal diseases that attack the leaves. Propagation: Propagate by seed, stem cuttings or dividing the rhizome.																		Etymology: The species epithet ""lauterbachiana"" was likely named after Carl Lauterbach, a German botanist who discovered the Yellow-breasted Bowerbird in 1896. 																		Caution:  The various parts of this species are toxic and should not be consumed."

The shape of the leaves somewhat shares some resemblence with a duck’s webbed foot. It produces off-white, milky coloured flowers that are borne on plumes.Better grown under semi-shaded and cool conditions and protected from direct tropical sunshine. Grow in well-draining, fertile soil that is constanly kept moist but not soggy. Propagation by means of seeds, stem-cuttings or division. Because seeds are not readily available, the most practical way is to stick a stem tip cutting into a pot of soil obtained from the material bought from the market or taken from an established plant. For each stem cutting, ensure there are several nodes to allow rooting. Crowded, mature clumps can also be dug up, split and planted separately.

Begonia rex was discovered in Assam, India. In the 1850s, it was introduced to the horticulture industry and crossed with other Begonia spp.. Today's hybrids originate from these crosses. Foliage: Leaves come in a wide variety of shapes, colours and patterns. Shapes include asymmetric, ovate, cordate and palmately lobed. Colours may have a metallic sheen, while patterns may consist of spots, stripes, swirls or streaks. Leaf size varies from 8 - 30 cm long. They usually have serrate or lobed leaf margins. Flowers: Flowers are pale pink. Male and female flowers occurs on the same plant. Flowers occur above the leaves on tall, erect stalks. Fruits: The dry, dehiscent fruits are known as capsules. The fruits are winged and split lengthwise to release the seeds. Landscaping: The foliage of Begonia rex hybrids comes in bright colours and bold patterns. They can be used to add colour to flower beds and borders in shady locations. They grow well in containers and can be used to decorate shady spots on a balcony or patio. Hybrids are also often grown indoors. Plants will last for years under optimal growing conditions, providing long-lasting enjoyment. Cultivation: This species grows best under bright filtered lighting, as direct sunlight will cause leaf scorch. Indoor plants that are placed in dim lighting may lose their bright colours and become more green. Plant in well-drained, porous soil, because the rhizome is prone to rotting in waterlogged soil. Allow the soil to dry between waterings. Keep the leaves dry to prevent leaf spot. Fertilize plants every two weeks with quarter-strength balanced complete liquid fertilizer (23-19-14). Plants will grow best in a humid environment. Leaf tips and margins that become brown is a sign of insufficient humidity. Increase humidity by placing potted plants on a tray of wet pebbles or using a room humidifier, but ensure adequate air flow to prevent fungal diseases, such as mildew and botrytis. Hybrids are also susceptible to mealy bugs. Optimum growth temperature for this species is about 18 to 24 °C. Pinch the branch tips to prevent plants from becoming leggy. Propagation: Propagate by leaf cuttings, stem cuttings, or rhizome division. This species is typically propagated by leaf cuttings. It has a high success rate, and new plants are formed in about 6 months. This method involves cutting leaves in multiple places across leaf veins. The leaf pieces are laid flat on the planting medium, and plantlets will form along the cut edge. Stem cuttings will root in about 20 days under optimal conditions. Although this species may also be propagated by seed, it is time-consuming and the daughter plants are likely to differ from the parent plant. Etymology: The genus ""Begonia"" was named after Michel Begon (1638 - 1710), a French patron of botany and former governor of Haiti (then called Santo Domingo). The specific epithet ""rex"" is derived from the Latin word ""regere"" which means king."

""Petals"" are actually showy petaloid false-stamens (staminodia). Fruits are globose explosive capsules, warty or softly spiny, mature from green to red to black. Seeds spherical, black, covered by very hard woody testa (seed coat), dense and sink in water.Suitable for landscaping flowerbeds and waterside borders. Inflorescences are smaller than most Canna species and hybrids, but plant is relatively free-flowering. Tolerates wet soils. If not grown for seeds, dying flowering stalks can be cut back for neater appearance. Propagate by division of clumps, rhizomes or seeds (should be scarified and soaked in water overnight before sowing). If grown in containers, divide clumps yearly.Similar-looking to the taller Canna indica (Edible Canna) which is differentiated by larger leaves, flowers that are bright red above and red-spotted yellow at the base, and purplish-green stems or stalks.Genus epithet Canna derived from Greek name for a certain type of reed. Species epithet indica refers to India, as Linnaeus (father of modern taxonomy) thought the plant also originated from India.

Habitat: Dry environments.																		Stem: Stem light purple and glabrous. It is herbaceous and thin. Tubers are produced at the nodes (the portion of stem directly attached to leaves). Foliage: Leaves small (1.3 cm wide, 2 cm long) and cordate (shaped like hearts). The top is green with white or light purple markings, while the bottom is pink or light purple. Flowers: Flowers are vertically oriented, tubular and pink with a small balloon-like base (2 cm long). The lobes at the apex are dark purple with purple hairs. They form arch-like structures over the opening of the flower. Fruits: Fruits are follicles, a type of dry fruit produced from one ovary.																		Landscaping: This species may be used as a focal plant to attract interest, because the flowers have a unique shape. It is ideal for hanging baskets that could be hung from tree branches or above a patio. Alternatively, consider potting the plant and training it to grow along a small, circular trellis to produce a decorative hoop of leaves. This species will be attractive hung against a wall like a curtain or from the top of a pergola (a type of trellis with vertical posts that support an open set of horizontal rafters). 																		Cultivation: This species is easy-to-grow. It will grow best under full sun, but it can also be grown under semi-shade. This species is prone to basal rot when it is watered too much or the soil becomes waterlogged. Allow the soil to dry before re-watering. For indoor plants, use a soilless or cactus mix with good drainage and feed on a monthly basis with a dilute solution of low nitrogen liquid fertilizer. Plants should be re-potted every 3 years. This species is usually resistant to pests, but it may be attacked by mealy bugs, whiteflies, spider mites and aphids. Propagation: Propagate by division or stem cuttings. For stem cuttings, remove a piece from the tip that contains 2 - 3 nodes by cutting the stem just beneath a node. You can also plant the tubers produced at the nodes of the stem.																		Etymology: The genus ""Ceropegia"" is derived from the Greek words ""keros"" meaning wax and ""pege"" meaning fountain. These terms refer to the flowers which look waxy and are shaped like fountains."

Stem: Erect, single stem appears woody. Although the stem appears hard and dry, this cultivar is a monocot and therefore lacks true wood. The rhizome (underground, horizontal stem) is thick and resembles a tuber. Foliage: Smooth, glossy, thick leaves are leathery and strap-shaped with entire leaf margin, raised midrib and pointed leaf apex (30 - 76 cm long, 10 - 15 cm wide). Leaf blade is green with a thin, coppery red or bright magenta edge. The petiole and the underside of the midrib is also coppery red or bright magenta. They are spirally arranged near the top of a single, erect stem. Flowers: Small, fragrant flowers (1 cm wide) are arranged in branched clusters known as panicles (30 cm long). They are rarely produced indoors. Fruits: Fruit is a red, leathery capsule containing black seeds.																		Landscaping: This cultivar is planted for its ornamental foliage which provides a tropical look. It is attractive in mass plantings and could be used as a low maintenance ground cover that does not need to be continually divided. It is suitable for container plantings and is often grown indoors. 																		Cultivation: This cultivar should be planted in fertile, well-draining soil. For container plantings, use a potting mix that is based on peat moss and does not contain perlite. Allow the top inch of soil to dry before rewatering and use only fluoride-free or low-fluoride water. Feed biweekly with a half-strength, 15-5-10 NPK fertilizer that contains micronutrients. Magnesium deficiency is a common problem among Ti plants which causes leaf yellowing, so make sure the fertilizer contains sufficient magnesium. It is susceptible to a variety of pests (eg., mealy bugs, aphids, spider mites, snails, slugs, nematodes and leafhoppers) and bacterial / fungal diseases caused by Cercospora, Phytophthora, and  Xanthomonas species. Propagation: Propagate by stem cuttings, rhizome division and air layering.																		Etymology: The genus ""Cordyline"" is derived from the Greek word for club (""cordyle""), referring to the thick rhizomes of this genus. The species epithet ""fruticosa"" is derived from the Latin word for bushy (""fruticosus""). The cultivar name ""Baby Ti"" refers to its relatively short stature compared to other Cordyline cultivars.																		Caution: The leaves contain saponins which are toxic to dogs and cats."

Landscaping: This cultivar is planted for its ornamental foliage, having an interesting mix of solid green and variegated leaves. It can be potted in a large container and placed on a sunny patio or even grown indoors. For a fuller look, a large specimen can be placed in the same container with 2 smaller specimens.																		Cultivation: This cultivar should be planted in fertile, well-draining soil. For container plantings, use a potting mix that is based on peat moss and does not contain perlite. Allow the top inch of soil to dry before rewatering and use only fluoride-free or low-fluoride water. Feed biweekly with a half-strength, 15-5-10 NPK fertilizer that contains micronutrients. Magnesium deficiency is a common problem among Ti plants which causes leaf yellowing, so make sure the fertilizer contains sufficient magnesium. It is susceptible to a variety of pests (eg., mealy bugs, aphids, spider mites, snails, slugs, nematodes and leafhoppers) and bacterial / fungal diseases caused by Cercospora, Phytophthora, and  Xanthomonas species. Propagation: Propagate by stem cuttings, rhizome division and air layering.																		Etymology: The genus ""Cordyline"" is derived from the Greek word for club (""cordyle""), referring to the thick rhizomes of this genus. The species epithet ""fruticosa"" is derived from the Latin word for bushy (""fruticosus""). 																		Caution: The leaves contain saponins which are toxic to dogs and cats."

Habitat: Occurs in primary and secondary forests at altitudes of up to 950 m. 																		Stem: Stem is round and herbaceous. Foliage: Glossy, alternate leaves are oblong with a wavy leaf margin, rounded base and acute apex (80 cm long, 15 cm wide). Young foliage is green on top and dark red to purple on the underside. Mature foliage is green on both sides with sometimes a light reddish hue on the underside. Flowers: About 40 - 50 flowers are arranged in a cup-shaped or tulip-like inflorescence (~6 cm wide). Only a few flowers are open at any given time. The inflorescences are borne on floral stalks that lack leaves (0.5 - 0.6 m tall). Fruits: A group of 2 - 20 indehiscent fruits are fused together. Individual fruits are pubescent and globular with an apex that is  flattened or a little depressed. The fruits are an important food source for rodents.  																		Landscaping: This species is planted in parks and public gardens. It is also planted in home gardens, but one should consider the large size this species attains at maturity (3 - 6 m) before planting. This species has low salt tolerance, so avoid planting in beach settings. However, it can be grown in a pot indoors, because the smaller soil volume will result in a more compact plant. In Hawaii, this species is often used in landscaping. 																		Cultivation: Plant in soil that is rich in humus. Protect plants from wind. When grown indoors, this species requires a humid environment and thorough watering. Propagation: Propagate by seed or by division of the rhizome.																		Etymology: The genus name ""Etlingera"" was named after A.E. Etlinger, a botanist of the 18th century who published an extensive description of the genus Salvia. The species epithet ""hemisphaerica"" means hemispherical. It likely refers to the cup-shaped inflorescence."

Can also be used as colourful groundcover to brighten up shady landscape areas receiving indirect dappled sunlight. Requires high humidity. Likes well-drained, loamy soils rich in organic matter. Water regularly to prevent withering, but avoid overwatering which may cause yellowing of leaves. Waterlogged soils may promote leaf and stem rot. Pinch off stem-tips to promote bushier growth. If grown for striking foliage, flower inflorescences may be removed. Propagate by stem cuttings, layering or division.Genus epithet 'Fittonia' named in honour of Elizabeth and Sarah Mary Fitton, 19th century authors of 'Conservations on Botany'. Species epithet 'albivenis' means 'white veined', a reference to the white-veined leaves of the species form.

Habitat: Occurs in the Amazon rainforests.																		Foliage: Leaves are fleshy, elliptic to ovate (8 - 13 cm long, 5 - 10 cm wide). Leaf texture is not flat, but rippled. The top is dark green with silver / grey stripes parallel to the midvein, while the bottom is dark reddish purple. Flowers: Flowers have 3 small petals with fringed edges (1.5 cm wide) and last only one day. 																		Landscaping: This species may be planted underneath specimen trees. In humid climates, it may be used as a groundcover for shady locations. The variegated leaves help to brighten dark areas. It is also ideal for terrariums.																		Cultivation: This species is fast-growing. It will grow best in a humid environment, such as a terrarium, greenhouse or on top of a drywell (a tray of water and small rocks that raises the humidity around a plant, but prevents the soil from becoming waterlogged). Plant in a moisture retentive soil mix with good drainage and high humus content (eg., African violet potting mix). For potted plants, allow the top 1 cm of soil to dry before re-watering and feed biweekly with a half strength 15-15-15 NPK fertilizer. This species is resistant to most pests. Propagation: Propagate by seed, layering, stem cuttings or re-planting the suckers.																		Etymology: The genus ""Geogenanthus"" is derived from 3 Greek words that mean earth (""geos""), borne (""genus"") and flower (""anthus""). The specific epithet ""poeppigii"" is named after E.F. Poeppig, a German explorer and professor of zoology (1798 - 1868)."

Habitat: Occurs in the understorey of forests in Southeast Asia. It is very rare due to overexploitation for the horticultural industry. Foliage: Leaves are long and lanceolate (20 - 25 cm long) with entire leaf margins. Leaves are glabrous above, but lightly pubescent below. It may be distinguished from named varieties by the presence of cordate leaf bases. Flowers: The inflorescence is a raceme that hangs downwards. Magenta, ovate bracts overlap one another and partially cover the floral stalk. Each flower is borne on a long purple stalk that is held perpendicular to the main axis of the inflorescence. Small, yellow flowers (2 - 3 cm long) are tubular with a single, elongated and arched stamen. The blooming period lasts for about a month. Fruits: Fruits are capsules. Seeds have a fleshy covering. Landscaping: This species is often planted for its attractive inflorescences. The purple bracts and yellow flowers provide striking contrast, while the pendent inflorescence rocks gracefully in the wind. It should be planted in the front of borders due to its short stature. The unique inflorescences are sure to attract interest, so consider planting them near a pathway or sidewalk for easy access. It makes an ideal accent plant for gardens in partly shady areas. Cultivation: Plant in slightly acidic soil enriched with humus and having good drainage. For potted plants, you can use a 1:2:1 mixture of peat moss, loam and sand / perlite, respectively. In tropical climates, it is best to grow this species in full shade to prevent the leaves from being scorched by the sun. This species is typically resistant to pests. Propagation: Propagate by dividing clumps or cutting the dormant rhizome into pieces. Plants may also be started from seed. Plant seeds in equal parts of peat moss and sand and incubate at 18 - 22 degrees Celsius. Seeds will germinate in about 3 weeks. Etymology: The genus ""Globba"" is a Latin version of ""galoba"" meaning ginger in the Amboinese language. The specific epithet ""winitii"" was named after Phya Winit Wanandorn, a famous Thai botanist who studied forest plant species."

Foliage: Opposite, glossy leaves are elliptic with entire or wavy leaf margin (13 cm long). Leaves are mostly green with a cream-coloured to yellow center that runs along the midvein. Leathery, deeply veined leaves have an uneven leaf texture. Flowers: Reddish purple or pinkish purple flowers are tubular and located near the stem tips in clusters (4 cm long, 1 cm wide). 																		Landscaping: This cultivar is grown for its ornamental, variegated foliage which create a tropical or cottage look. It can be potted in a large container and would grow well on a sunny patio as a specimen planting. The variegated, slightly wrinkled leaves will provide colour and texture as a border or background planting. It can be pruned into an informal hedge or screen. 																		Cultivation: This fast-growing species is easy to grow and ideal for hot, humid climates. It grows best under full sun, but tolerates partial shade. Specimens should ideally be planted 1.2 - 1.8 m apart in well-drained, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soil enriched with compost. Soil should be consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Apply a complete, balanced fertilizer once a month for outdoor plants and twice a month for potted plants. This cultivar should be pruned to maintain a compact shape. It is usually resistant to most pests and diseases, but may be attacked by mealy bugs and aphids. Propagation: Propagate by stem cuttings which root easily.																		Etymology: The genus ""Graptophyllum"" is derived from the Greek word for inscribed (""graptos"") and the Latin word for leaf (""phyllon""). The reference is to the leaves typical of species in this genus which look like they were painted. The species epithet ""pictum"" originates from the Latin word ""pictus"" which means painted or colored and refers to the colourful leaves of this species.

The uneven, wrinkled leaves will provide texture to landscapes when placed in mass plantings. It can be pruned into a hedge or screen. 																		Cultivation: This fast-growing species is easy to grow and ideal for hot, humid climates. Leaves will be most colourful when plants are grown under full sun, but plants can tolerate partial shade.

Foliage: Large, ovate leaves have a mottled pattern of dark green, light green and yellow patches. Flowers: Unisexual flowers resemble calla lily flowers. The flower consists of a white stick-like spadix and brownish petal-like spathe that surrounds the spadix like a hood. Fruits: Fleshy fruits are known as berries.																		Landscaping:  This species is grown for its large, variegated leaves. It is suitable for container plantings and makes an ideal houseplant. This species is relatively rare in the horticultural trade, and thus, provides a unique look as a specimen plant.																		Cultivation: This species is easy to grow. It should be planted in fertile, well-draining soil that is kept moist. It can tolerate shady conditions, but it will grow best under partial shade. It requires a humid environment, so daily misting is needed. It is resistant to most diseases. Propagation: Propagate by stem cuttings.																		Etymology: The genus ""Homalomena"" is derived from the Greek words for flat (""homalos"") and moon (""mene""). The name is a translation of the common name of a plant. The species epithet ""wallichii"" was named after Dr. Nathaniel Wallich, a Danish surgeon with a keen interest in plants (1786 - 1854). He was founder of the Indian Museum in Calcutta which focused on the flora and fauna of India. He later became Superintendent of the East India Company's Botanical Garden at Calcutta."

A short day plant, it requires at least 6 weeks of 14 hr nights to induce flowering. Flowers can be red, pink, dark pink, yellow or white, depending on hybrids. The colours of the flowers can be enhanced under bright sunlight. May be propagated using stem or leaf cuttings and those grown from cuttings grow faster and better than those from seeds. New plantlets may grow on leaf margins occasionally. When watering the plant, wait for the water to be fully absorbed before re-watering as over-watering may cause stem rot. Plants are not frequently attacked by pests, but continue to keep a look out for mealy bugs, mites, aphids and caterpillars."

Stem: Young stems are covered in tiny, soft hairs (puberulent). Mature stem has greyish bark and indistinct angles. Foliage: Opposite leaves are narrowly elliptic or oblong with wavy leaf margin and distinct drip tip (10 - 23 cm long, 2.5 - 9 cm wide). Glossy, leathery leaves have slightly sunken veins that create a quilt-like texture. Flowers: Salverform, 5-lobed flowers are pink with a dark red throat (3 - 5 cm long, 1.5 - 2.5 cm wide). Flowers are arranged in small clusters near the stem tips. Fruits: Fleshy, pitted, 1-seeded fruits are known as drupes (2.5 cm long, 2 cm wide). They are dull red, ellipsoid and covered in soft hairs. Landscaping: This species is planted as an ornamental shrub, because it produces lovely pink flowers throughout the year. It is usually planted in small groups and can be used as a hedge or barrier. In addition, this plant grows well in containers and would be suitable for a sunny patio. Cultivation: This species grows slowly at about 10 cm a year. Specimens should be planted 0.5 - 0.6 m apart in fertile, well-draining soil that is slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6.5 - 7.5). This species is highly adaptable, tolerating both drought and waterlogged soils. It will flower best under full sun, but it also grows well under partial shade. Avoid pruning frequently, because it inhibits both flowering and overall growth. Propagation: Propagate by seed, stem cuttings, marcotting and air layering. Etymology: The species epithet ""fruticosa"" is derived from the Latin word for bushy (""fruticosus""), referring to the species' growth habit."

It can be pruned into a yellowish dense screening plant or formal hedge that will contrast nicely with dark green foliage plants. Consider placing it in the back of your garden as a brightly coloured background. This cultivar is also suitable as a topiary specimen.																		Cultivation: This cultivar is easy-to-grow. It is tolerant of most well-draining soil types, but grows best in acidic to neutral soil (pH 5.5 - 7.5). Apply mulch to maintain soil moisture. It should be pruned regularly to promote new growth. Feed once a year with a slow release fertilizer. For cultivation as a hedge, space individuals 1 m apart. This cultivar is resistant to most pests and diseases.

It has also become a vegetable commonly available in the markets and supermarkets in Java.Growth Form: An erect, perennial herbaceous plant that grows in both aquatic and swampy terrestrial environments, that is laticiferous (= containing latex). Reproductive growth is achieved through tillering, which is a type of vegetative reproduction accomplished through the production of subterranean shoots that are more or less erect (= tillers).Habitat: L. flava is found naturally in marshy shallow locations, such as rice fields, fish ponds and drains, up to 1300 m altitude.Foliage: Leaves are yellow-green, smooth and hairless and set in a basal rosette. Petioles are 5-75 cm long, thick and triangular in cross-section with many air chambers. Leaf blades are orbicular (= approximately circular in outline), broadly elliptic or ovate in shape, with 9-13 main nerves and numerous secondary nerves running in parallel.Flowers: Yellow flowers are borne on inflorescences, known as umbels (= flower stalks arise from a common point on the inflorescence stalk), 3-15 flowers on each. The inflorescence stalk (= peduncle) grows up to 90 cm in length, standing erect when flowering and curving downwards when fruiting. The flowers open in the morning only for a few hours.Fruits: Fruit compound, globose or broadly ellipsoid in shape and contains numerous seeds that are horseshoe-shaped and dark brown in colour.Cultivation: can be cultivated all year round, producing flowers throughout the year, requiring a fertile soil that should be enriched with organic fertiliser 1-2 weeks before planting. The recommended planting distance is about 30 cm between plants. Propagation may be carried out by layers or seeds. Etymology: The genus name, Limnocharis, is Greek for “marsh beauty”, in reference to the natural habitat of the plant, while the specific epithet, flava, means “bright almost pure yellow, which is the colour of the flowers of the plant."

Found in standing pools of water with leaves floating on surface, or growing in very swampy wet soils. Stems reddish, brittle. Leaves diamond-shaped with toothed margins, radiate outwards to form mosaic-like rosettes. Edges of central and older leaves turn bright red when plant is grown under bright light. Leaf rosettes are fully extended during daytime with gaps in between leaves. At night, the rosettes contract such that the leaves overlap one another.Flowers bright yellow, cup-shaped, solitary, produced in leaf axils from Jun to Aug in native habitats. Fruits are explosive capsules.Suitable for ponds or containers with 30-60cm depth. Plant needs to be rooted in substrate below water surface. Avoid mixing with fish, as brittle stems make plant susceptible to being torn apart by fish.Genus epithet 'Ludwigia' is named after German botanist and professor of medicine, Christian Gottlieb Ludwig (1709-1773). Ludwig corresponded with Carl Linnaeus (father of modern botanical taxonomy) about plant classifications, and Linnaeus dedicated the genus 'Ludwigia' in honor of Ludwig. Species epithet 'sedoides' means 'resembling sedum', a reference to the leaves which resemble those of certain Sedum species in terms of appearance and colour changes under strong light."

Habitat: Occurs on moist soil in meadows and near the edge of forests or streams.Foliage: Opposite arrangement of leaves (1.5 - 5 cm long). Leaves green and ovate or elliptic, having a serrate leaf margin. Flowers: Small, light purple or white flowers (0.3 – 0.6 cm long) occur in whorls (1 – 2 cm wide). Flowers campanulate (shaped like bells, but petals slightly separating at the bottom) and located in the leaf axils (between the base of the leaf and adjacent stem). Fruits: Brown fruits are nutlets each containing a single seed. Nutlets are formed when the seed-bearing structure fragments into one-seeded pieces.Landscaping: Grown in herb gardens or containers. Can be grown indoors or outdoors.Cultivation: Tolerates a wide range of soil types from sandy to clay soils and from acidic to alkaline soils. However, it does not tolerate saline soils. Grows best in soils that are slightly acidic. The plant is not drought tolerant. Has spreading roots that may cause the plant to dominate and take over an area. Put outdoor plants in a pot placed in the soil to prevent excessive growth. For maximum production of essential oils, grow the plant under full sun. Propagation: Propagate by seeds, stem cuttings or division. Seeds do not require cold stratification (i.e., soaking them in water and placing at cold temperature before planting) to germinate.Etymology: The genus name “Mentha” comes from a Greek myth about a nymph named “Minthe” (also known as Menthe) who became Pluto’s mistress. Pluto’s jealous wife transformed Minthe into a mint plant. Caution: Consumption of large quantities of the plant’s essential oil may induce an abortion."

Pseudostems and underside of leaves have whitish powdery coating.Flowers yellow, inconspicuous, held in long racemes (fruiting stem), enclosed by scarlet-red leathery bracts. Plant is monoecious, with separate male and female flowers in inflorescence on the same plant. Flower pollinated by ants, bees and birds. Female flowers can also set sterile fruits without pollination by means of parthenocarpy.Fruits (""fingers"") are pulpy berries with leathery outer peel, formed in layers called combs or ""hands"" consisting of 10 - 20 bananas each, with several ""hands"" per fruiting stalk. Each ""hand"" consists of many ""fingers"" packed closely into a fused mass, which resembles a baseball mitt or a cupped hand. Two adjacent ""hands"" lying next to each other form what appears to be a clasped pair of hands. Fruits ripen (without splitting) from green to yellow in 2 - 3 months, with edible vanilla-flavoured pulp.Dwarf cultivar from Saba sub-group of typically massive banana species. Plant is ABB triploid, formed from hybridization of pulpy-fruited Musa acuminata (diploid AA) and Musa balbisiana (tetraploid BBBB), producing short, plump and sweet ""Lady Finger"" type fruits, suitable as dessert bananas -- as opposed to Cavendish type of bananas found at supermarkets.Popular collectors' item amongst banana ethusiasts. Ideal for economic gardens, or as focal plant for its unqiue-looking fruits, and to impart tropical feel to the landscape. Vigorous and fast-growing. Prefers moist soils and lots of watering, but does not tolerate being soaked in standing water. Fairly wind-resistant, but avoid locating plant in very windy areas to prevent leaves from being shredded into thin strips. Heavy feeder -- fertilize once monthly if soil is fertile, or once weekly if soil is poor. Prune off dying old fronds from pseudostem for a neater look. Prop up fruiting stem if this is leaning excessively due to the weight of the inflorescence and maturing fruits. Post-fruiting pseudostems may start to decline, so these can be removed to make space for emerging suckers, Propagate by division of suckers and seeds (rarely produced and may not be viable).Genus epithet 'Musa' named after Antonius Musa (63 - 14 BC), physician to first Roman emperor, Octavius Angustus. Also the Arabic name for the fruit, perhaps after Prophet Musa (Moses). Musa x paradisiaca form named by Linnaeus in relation to the Qu'ran's reference to banana as the ""Tree of Paradise""."

Leaf undersides are wine red also. Insignificant flowers and edible fruits up to 9 cm long are produced terminally.  A relatively fast-growing ornamental banana that is best grown under semi-shaded conditions as full sun conditions can cause the attractive wine red blotches on the leaves to fade away. Grow in a sheltered location with well-drained and fertile soil that is protected from winds. Keep roots moist and cool and feed generously by applying a layer of compost as mulch around the base of the plant.

Foliage: Leaves are glossy, dark green on top and maroon below. Elliptic leaves have a serrate leaf margin. Flowers: Cream-coloured to light yellow flowers have tiny maroon spots and purple hairs. They are tubular and 5-lobed. Flowers occur in small clusters in the leaf axils (area between the leaf and stem). Fruits: Fruits are capsules. Landscaping: This species is grown mainly for its attractive, glossy leaves. The bright maroon leaf underside stands in strong contrast to the dark green colour on top. It is ideal for interior decoration and container planting. For mixed plantings in containers, pIace this species near the edge of the container. In tropical climates, it can be used in mass plantings. Cultivation: This species is easy-to-grow. Plant in deep, porous soil with good drainage. Apply a fertilzer for flowering plants every 20 - 25 days. Alternatively, add a slow release fertilizer to the soil every 3 - 4 months. This species grows best in a humid environment. It is susceptible to fungal diseases. Propagation: Propagate by seed, stem cuttings and leaf cuttings. Etymology: The genus ""Nautilocalyx"" comes from the Greek words for sailor (""nautilos"") and calyx or leaf-like structures at the base of many flowers (""kalyx""). The reference may be to the numerous triangle-shaped sepals (collectively forming the calyx) which occur in species of this genus. The sepals may resemble sailboats. The species epithet ""lynchii"" was named after English botanist Richard Irwan Lynch (1850-1924), curator of Cambridge Botanic Garden."

Habitat: Occurs in savanna grasslands. Found in shady locations near streams or between rocks that become submerged after heavy rainfall.																		Stems: Stems are thickly covered in soft, long hairs. Foliage: Opposite, sessile leaves are elliptic with entire leaf margin. They are deeply veined and densely covered in long, soft hairs. Flowers: White or bluish to purplish flowers are bilabiate with a small, bi-lobed upper lip and a large, tri-lobed lower lip. White flowers are uniformly white, while purple flowers have an upper lip streaked with dark purple lines. Flowers are arranged in spike inflorescences and occur between leaf-like bracts that are ovate and hairy. Fruits: Dry, dehiscent fruits are known as capsules. They are oblong and pointed at the tips.																		Landscaping: This species produces striking bluish flowers. It is not commonly used in landscaping, so it would provide a unique look. This species could be used as a groundcover in poorly drained areas, because it is tolerant of waterlogged soils. It is also shade tolerant, so it could be planted underneath a tree or large shrub. 																		Cultivation: This species grows best in fertile, well-drained soil that is kept moist. However, it is tolerant of waterlogged soils. Propagation: Propagate by seed or stem cuttings.																		Etymology: The species epithet ""canescens"" refers to the leaves which are canescent (covered in white, thin hairs)."

Native to tropical lowland peat swamp forests,  Leaves lanceolate to spoon-shaped, sessile (stalkless), glossy green when mature, velvety reddish-brown when young. Leaf tips terminate in coiling tendrils, which under ideal conditions are modified into prey-catching pitchers. In nature, pitchers are partially filled with rainwater enriched with digestive enzymes secreted by glands on waxy internal wall. Lower pitchers usually 5cm tall by 3cm across, globose and squatly urn-like, with short hairy keels on outer wall, and massed together side by side into basal rosettes. Pitcher lids atypically narrow and back-flipped, do not cover pitcher mouth (unlike those of other Nepenthes species). Normally sold in trade as tissue-cultured clones of ""Brunei Red"" form discovered in Brunei and Borneo. Pitchers dark red (or sometumes red speckled with green), with similar colouration for corrugated peristome (mouth). Resembles the more expensive Cantley's Red and William's Red cultivars.Plant is diocecious, with male and female flowers found on separate plants. Flowers small, yellow, clustered into panicle inflorescences up to 45cm across. Blooming occurs once or twice per year, lasting for several weeks.Often cultivated as an oddity plant in pots or hanging baskets, and in concept gardens for its decorative pitchers. Also suitable in air-conditioned areas, as long as plant is enclosed within humid terrarium. Grows well under bright indirect sunlight. Prefers moist, poor-nutrient acidic media like peatmoss, sphagnum moss or salt-free cocopeat. Avoid fertilizing, especially with fast-release fertilizers, which may burn or kill the plant, or result in excessive foliage growth without pitcher formation. Propagate by seeds (variable progenies), or stem cuttings. If taking tip cuttings, use 4-node cuttings (tip plus 3 lower leaves) to prevent tender growing tip from rotting before establishment. Single-node cuttings from lower parts of the plant are also possible. Basal rosettes joined by underground runners can be divided and potted up separately.Genus epithet 'Nepenthes' means 'no sorrow' or 'banished sorrow', based on the ancient Greek name of another plant that apparently relieves grief and produces euphoria, and used here in connection with the reported medicinal qualities of some Nepenthes species. Species epithet ampullaria' means 'flask-shaped', a reference to the pitchers."

Foliage: Leaves are linear with an entire leaf margin and a pointed apex. Leaves are not stiff with some bending over and some erect. Older leaves may be more green and less variegated than younger foliage. Flowers: Flowers are bell-shaped. They are arranged in inflorescences known as racemes in which one main axis bears several stalked flowers that are directly connected to it. Fruits: Fruits are oblong to ellipsoid berries (1.3 cm long).																		Landscaping: This cultivar makes an excellent, long-lasting groundcover or edging. The variegated leaves would also be good for colour accent beds, rock gardens or decorative plant arrangements. It can tolerate shady areas that are prone to short periods of dryness. The lighter colour of the leaves would also make shady areas look less dark. This species is also suitable for high rise balconies where it may experience high winds, heat, lighting that varies from full sun to full shade, and drought due to wind and heat exposure. It produces excellent foliage in the tropical lowlands, but usually does not flower. Flowering occurs in tropical highlands and temperate climates.																		Cultivation: This cultivar has a moderate growth rate and requires little maintenance. Plant in well-drained, fertile and slightly acidic soil containing organic matter. For groundcovers, plant small clumps 0.2 m apart to cover the area quickly. Water the plants regularly for best growth, but established plants are tolerant of short periods of drought. Feed every month with a 15-15-15 NPK liquid fertilizer. It occasionally produces green side shoots that should be quickly removed, because they will outcompete the variegated ones. Young foliage may be attacked by slugs. Plants grown on a balcony should be rotated by a quarter turn every week for balanced growth. Propagation: Propagate by dividing the clumps of plants.																		Etymology: The genus name ""Ophiopogon"" means snake's beard. It is derived from 2 Greek words, ""ophis"" meaning snake and ""pogon"" meaning beard. This name is translated from the Japanese name (""riuno fige"")."

Considered by some as a weedy invasive species, P. suberosa can quickly overgrow and smother other plants, its tendrils winding around the stems and leaves of other plants in order to climb up. This enables this sun-loving plant to obtain greater exposure to sunlight. Yet, there are others who use this climber as an informal groundcover or low-climbing vine in their gardens. In addition, P. suberosa has been recognised to have ecological value, having been observed as both a butterfly nectar plant, as well as a host plant for caterpillars of butterflies including the Tawny Coster (Acraea violae), Gulf Fritillary (Agaulis vanillae), Julia Heliconian (Dryas iulia), Mexican Silverspot (Dione moneta) and Zebra Heliconian (Heliconius charithonia).

Foliage: Smooth leaves are ovate to elliptic with entire leaf margin and prominent yellow, net-like venation. The midvein on the leaf underside is reddish, while yellow lateral veins (those directly connected to the midvein) curve upwards toward the tip. Younger leaves are mostly yellow with greenish tints, while older leaves are green. Adjacent pairs of opposite leaves are perpendicular to one another in a decussate leaf arrangement. Leaves have very short petioles. Flowers: Orchid-like, 5-petalled flowers are white with a reddish purple center. Stalked flowers are arranged on a yellowish stalk along 1 main axis in an inflorescence known as a raceme. Inflorescences are borne at the branch tips. Fruits: Dry dehiscent fruits are known as capsules.																		Landscaping:  This species is attractive in mass plantings. Consider planting it underneath trees. It is also suitable for container plantings and could be placed on patios or kept indoors.																		Cultivation: This species is easy-to-grow and has a moderately fast growth rate. It should be planted in well-drained, but moist soil that is rich in compost. Plants require a humid environment, so indoor plants should be grouped with other plants to increase humidity. They should be protected from strong winds. Propagation: Propagate by stem cuttings.																		Etymology: The genus ""Pseuderanthemum"" means False Eranthemum. Plants in the genus Pseuderanthemum are similar, yet distinct from those of the genus Eranthemum. The prefix ""pseudo-"" is derived from the Greek word for untrue (""pseudes"")."

Plants reproduce asexually via underground horizontal stems known as rhizomes (2mm wide). New roots and shoots emerge from various points along the rhizome. Plants also reproduce sexually. Habitat: Occurs on moist or sandy soil in coastal plains, marshes, wet savannas, ditches, pastures, and along roads.									Foliage: Leaves green and linear with a pointed tip. Leaves are narrow, about 3 mm wide. When leaves become dehydrated, they fold along the midvein to conserve water. Flowers: Small clusters of spikelets are surrounded by petal-like bracts (1 - 11 cm long). Bracts are white about 1 - 2 cm from the center and green for the remainder of the bract. The cross-section of the floral stalk is triangular. Fruits: Fruits are egg-shaped and classified as achenes. Achene fruits are dry and indehiscent (does not break open at maturity) with a single seed. Each spikelet produces several fruits.																		Landscaping: Ideal for water gardens or along the edge of ponds. Can be used as edging for gardens. It is especially attractive when grown among small stone boulders. The white color of the bracts makes a neutral, but contrasting background for plants with colored flowers.									Cultivation: Able to grow in poorly drained soil or even slightly submerged in water. If grown in regular soil, water abundantly. Grows in a variety of soil types, such as sand, clay and loam. Prefers basic soils, but also grows in approximately neutral soils. Propagation: Propagate by dividing the plants. 									Etymology: The genus name ""Rhynchospora"" is derived from the Greek terms ""rhynchos"" which mean beak and ""spora"" which means seed. Many species in this genus have beak-like fruits. The species epithet ""colorata"" refers to the white color of the bracts."

Habitat: Occurs in low-lying bushland at an altitude of 800 - 900 m. It is considered a weed in Central Africa.																		Stems: Stems are angled. Foliage: Opposite leaves are ovate with entire leaf margin. Leaf apex may be acute or have a drip tip. Flowers: Salverform flowers have 5 pink lobes that vary slightly in size (3 cm long, 2.5 cm wide). One of the 5 lobes has a distinct red patch near the base of the petal, while the other 4 lobes may or may not have similar, but smaller red markings. The tip of the petal may be rounded or slightly pointed. Flowers are arranged around a spike inflorescence. Fruits: Dry, explosively dehiscent fruits are known as capsules. They are elongated and flattened like a paddle with a slightly wavy margin near the sharply pointed apex. They open lengthwise to release a few disk-shaped, dark brown seeds  Seeds are attached to hook-like structures inside the fruit which may cause seeds to fly further away from the plant during dehiscence. 																		Landscaping: This species is grown as an ornamental shrub for its showy pink to red flowers. It is ideal for attracting butterflies as a nectar plant. This species is fairly rare in the horticultural trade, so it would provide interest to your garden as a specimen plant.  																		Cultivation: This species is fast growing and hardy. Mature plants are tolerant of both drought and heat. They should be grown in fertile, well-drained soil. Plant this species in full sun or light shade, because shady conditions inhibit flowering and result in leggy plants. Feed plants with a fertilizer rich in phosphorous to promote flowering. Avoid using nitrogen rich fertilizers, because they encourage development of leaves rather than flowers. Try not to prune this species frequently, because flowers are produced from the new growth. Propagation: Propagate by seed or stem cuttings. Cuttings will root easily and produce flowers within a year.																		Etymology: The genus ""Ruspolia"" was named after Italian naturalist Eugenio Ruspoli (1866-1893). The species epithet ""hypocrateriformis"" is Latin for salverform and refers to the shape of the flowers."

Bright yellow flowers, in spikes, tubular, 5 cm long, surrounded by red or orange bracts. Place in an area which can receive filtered sunlight, as plant does not tolerate direct full sun. If grown indoors, mist twice daily as it prefers moist conditions. Prune back after flowering to maintain foliage density. Propagate by cuttings. Showy flowers and foliage make it an impressive ornamental plant, indoors and outdoors. Grown as borders or hedges in well-drained moist soil."

Inflorescences are located at branch tips or in leaf axils. Trees begin to flower at 2 - 3 years of age. Fruits: Fruits are long, flattened pods with numerous ellipsoid seeds.  																		Landscaping: This free-flowering tree species has an attractive rounded crown with fine leaf texture. It is often planted as a roadside or ornamental tree.  																		Cultivation: This species is fast-growing and tolerant of infertile soils, drought and flooding. It does not grow well in shallow soils. Propagation: Propagate by seed. Seeds have a maximum storage life of 3 years. Fresh seeds have a high germination rate, whereas stored seeds should be soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid or boiling water for 10 - 30 min to promote germination.

There are long, straight thorns on the bottom side of the midrib and petiole. Flowers: Five-lobed, star-shaped flowers (6.5 - 7.5 cm wide) have long, bright yellow anthers which are pollen-bearing structures. Petals are initially dark purple, but fade to light purple and then white over several days. Bisexual or male flowers occur in small tri-coloured clusters known as racemes. Fruits: Round, fleshy fruits are known as berries (3 - 4 cm wide). Landscaping: This species is planted for its large, colourful flowers which are produced throughout the year. It is best planted alone as a specimen plant. Although normally planted in the ground, it will grow well in large containers placed on a sunny patio. Cultivation: This species grows and flowers best in full sun, but it can also tolerate light shade. It should be planted in fertile, well-draining soil enriched with compost. Apply mulch to the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture. This species has a dense, irregular crown which should be thinned with selective pruning to prevent the tree from leaning. Use formative pruning to produce a more pleasing crown shape. Propagation: Propagate by seed, stem cuttings or air layering. Etymology: The species epithet ""wrightii"" was named after American botanist Charles Wright (1811 - 1885)."

Habitat: Occurs in tropical rainforests, ravines and along streams. It is becoming increasingly rare in the wild due to habitat destruction and currently has a vulnerable conservation status.																		Stem: Woody stem has grey, smooth bark. Foliage: Light green leaves are trifoliate, consisting of 3 oblong leaflets (leaves 25 cm long, leaflets 8 - 13 cm long). Flowers: Claw-shaped flowers have a unique bluish green color (8 - 13 cm long). Flowers are arranged in long, hanging inflorescences known as pendent trusses or pseudoracemes (1.5 - 3 m long). Fruits: Fruit is a fleshy oblong or round pod  (5 - 15 cm long) that has a short curly beak at the apex. It contains up to 12 light brown, oblong seeds. 																	Landscaping: This species is planted for its unique and beautiful flowers. The vine can be trained over a trellis or pergola. Although this species flowers best when planted in the ground, it also flowers in large containers that are placed in sunny locations.																		Cultivation: Plant this species in fertile, well-draining soil that is slightly acidic to neutral (pH = 6 - 7). It will grow best if roots are located in a shady area, while leaves receive full sunlight. Apply a fertilizer rich in phosphorous bimonthly to promote blooming (eg., 7-9-5 NPK) at a concentration of 0.5 teaspoon per gallon of water. The stem needs to be at least 2 cm wide for flowering to occur. This species is resistant to most insects, but root diseases are likely to occur in soggy soils. Propagation: Propagate by stem cuttings or grafting. Stem cuttings will root better with bottom heat.			Etymology: The species epithet ""macrobotrys"" is derived from the Greek words for large (""macros"") and cluster (""botrys""). The reference is likely to the long, hanging inflorescences."

Habitat: Found in monsoonal climates at altitudes from 0 - 400 m. Occurs in dry deciduous forests in either pure or mixed stands.																		Stems: It has strong, nearly solid erect stems known as culms (7 - 13 m long, 2 - 6 cm wide). The internodes (the area between points of leaf attachment to the culm) are 15 - 30 cm apart. The culm is mostly light green with thin, white bands underneath the nodes where leaves are attached. The papery remainder of triangular culm sheaths surround the culm above the nodes. Foliage: Each branch produces about 4 - 12 linear, pointed leaves (7 - 15 cm long, 0.6 - 1.2 cm wide). Leaves are light green with entire leaf margins. Flowers: The inflorescence consists of a highly branched set of spikelets (tiny, stalkless flowers borne along one small, main axis). Flowering occurs unpredictably, sometimes at intervals up to 40 years.  Fruits: Beaked fruits are small and cylindrical (0.5 cm long, 0.3 cm wide).									 									Landscaping: The narrow leaves of this species are easily rustled by the wind, creating an elegant, peaceful atmosphere. This species is ideal for screening, because it forms erect, tight clumps. A small clump could be planted in gardens for an attractive, Asian look. It is often planted in containers to decorate monasteries in Thailand. 																		Cultivation: This species grows best on fertile, well-drained soil. However, it is tolerant of nutrient poor soils. Propagation: Propagate by seed, culm cutting (similar to a stem cutting) or rhizome division.																		Etymology: The genus ""Thyrsostachys"" is derived from the Greek words for stalk (""thursos"") and head of grain (""stachus""). It refers to the grain-like appearance of the inflorescence. The species epithet ""siamensis"" is a reference to Thailand as this species's country of origin. Siam was the old name of Thailand. The common name ""Monastery Bamboo"" comes from the fact that it is often planted around monasteries in Thailand. It was also named ""Umbrella Handle Bamboo,"" because the culms are used to make umbrella handles, as well as other handicrafts.
